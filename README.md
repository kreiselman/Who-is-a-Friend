# Who-is-a-Friend

Final Project for CS 4342: Machine Learning.
Created by Grant Ferguson, Jusitn Kreiselman and Ken Morton.

This was our attempt for the Who is a Friend Kaggle Competition. https://www.kaggle.com/c/whoisafriend/overview

We were tasked with determining if two people are friends. We used both shallow and deep learning models for our programs. 


The files included in the project are as follows:

The shallow models can be found in linearRegression.py, logisiticRegression.py
and randomBaseline.py

The Deep models can be found in deeplearning 1-4 for the non rfe versions and 
deeplearningRFE 1-4 for the RFE version. The 1-4 represent how many layers are used
in the model.

The included csv files are our final results that we submitted to get kaggle scores.
They will update when the corresponding code is run.

The test and train csv were procided by the kaggle competition.
